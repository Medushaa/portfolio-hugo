Followed the official Inktober prompts for 20 Days. And it's "Masu Version" coz I didn't Ink XDD. I don't know how to.

(Don't really feel like typing much. Here are the outcomes):

## <u> Day 1 to 9 </u>
> <img src="/images/day1-9.jpg" alt="Day 1 to 9" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">


## <u> Day 10 to 20 </u>
> <img src="/images/day10-20.jpg" alt="Day 10 to 20" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

## <u> Day 21 to 30 </u>
I gave up. It got boring also, assignments started piling up.
