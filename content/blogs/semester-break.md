The begining of this semester break was kinda awkward this time because one the faculties gave me the wrong grade and without my correct grade published, I wasn't really feeling like the semester has truely ended. 

Anyways, I'll keep it short. :zap: 

I don't have many frends to go on hangouts for the break. So, instead I made a list of things I want to do and try before the new semester starts. Here's a litol collage of those things:

1. <u>Blender</u>: just a lemon park....
2. <u>Drawing on tablet</u>: Bought the Inifity painter app just for this...
3. <u>Crochet</u>: I was following a youtube tutorial to make a tiny octopus. Mine got soo tiny that I couldn't crochet any further and gave up. That's how I ended up with this lil finger hat instead.
4. <u>Make stickers</u>: I found another reason to use the app I wasted my money on. So, I drew some things that I love and now I'm waiting to print them as stickers. (iyes, i luv null sets)
5. <u>Make cute site</u>: working on itttt
6. <u>Godot project</u>: I followed some youtube tutorials to start it and then got stuck with how to shrink the dialogue box and gave up:
